	<h3>A BRIEF HISTORY OF SERVERS</h3>
		<h5>The Rise of Servers</h5>
		<p>
			Want an easy way to build websites without maintaining custom code or messy machines? 
			A static website is the perfect option. 
			Static HTML files reside on a machine's file-system always ready to be sent to clients via special "Server" software. 
			This Server software assumes the responsibility of sending these static files to a client browser. 
			Traditionally, static sites still require managing a machine; 
			it just doesn't execute custom written code (thanks to the magical "server" software!). 
			With the rise of Cloud services, this all becomes easier! 
			Forgot about managing machines and configuring your server, instead, upload static html pages to a Cloud hosting solution and let them manage everything else. 
		</p>
		<h5>The Rise of Server Rendering</h5>
		<p>
			Along comes data, business logic, and the rise of dynamically rendered web pages. 
			<i>We're now officially a web application folks</i>. 
			Web pages need to change with data, and "server" software won't cut it. 
			Pages are generated to embed data into their html.
			Database connectivity is now a necessity, and that means custom server code. 
		</p>
		<h5>The Fall of Server Rendering</h5>
		<p>
			Everything changed when browsers advanced... </br>
			Javascript allows browsers to make asynchrnous server calls without ever refreshing the page. 
			By querying servers for just data, browsers can now render their own dynamic content. 
			And with that, server rendered web pages takes their last bow... return of the static page! 
		</p>
		<h5>The Rise of Server APIs</h5>
		<p>
			Static pages make the return to center stage! 
			Javascript embedded inside static pages is now capable of rendering dynamic content from the browser. 
			But what does this mean for servers? 
			Since servers no longer serve HTML they instead focus on serving data. 
			This decoupling enables the evolution of server APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). 
			Web pages can now integrate with multiple API Servers to be served data from various sources. 
			See Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, a means of integrating various data sources. 
		</p>
		<h5>The Return of Server Rendering?</h5>
		<p>
			Browsers are doing some heavy lifting running all this Javascript. 
			Are you noticing long load times and slow web pages? 
			Since servers off-loaded their rendering responsiblities, client devices are exceedly strained. 
			Is inefficient javascript to blame? 
			Will Javascript optimizations be enough? Or will the power of the cloud give server rendering the strength to return? 
			<b>Not likely!</b> Browsers sole responsibility is to display content, they can only get more efficient from here... 
		</p>
	<h3>SINGLE-PAGE vs MULTI-PAGE</h3>
		<p>
			Advancements in browser javascript and the rise of server APIs has built the foundation for single-page applications. 
			Traditionally, navigating between multiple pages causes an entire page re-rendering. More often than not some content doesn't usually change between pages. 
			Often times headers, footers, menus, and titles stay unmodified between pages. 
			So we must ask, why should we reload an entire page just to render partial content? 
			Single page applications address this concern by using modern browser javascript feature to perform partial page rendering. 
			Modern web applications should all use a single-page architecture. 
			It just doesn't make sense to use a multi-page architecture anymore... 
			A combination architecture can still be used if you sub-divide your application into separate rendered pages, 
			but this is an exceptional use-cases. 
			With that said, SPA is easier said than done, maintaininig speed, state, history, and events is a major programmatic challenge.
